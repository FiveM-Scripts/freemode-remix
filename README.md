# freemode-remix
Alternative Freeroam Gamemode that works without any Database. Aims to be kinda like GTA:O Freemode.

**Installation:**
1. Download this (Clone or Download -> Download ZIP).
2. Extract to your resources folder.
3. Add the resource to your AutoStartResources.
4. (Re)start server.

Stuff in *Freeroam* folder is C# source code (Visual Studio Project).

**NOTE:** Currently WIP. It's recommended to use it in conjunction with [Simple Trainer](https://de.gta5-mods.com/scripts/simple-trainer-for-gtav) for spawning vehicles and weapons (shouldn't be used for anything else though) until the gamemode is mature enough. Other mods are not recommended as they might break functionality.
